1. True or false: Message Authentication Code (MAC) prevents an adversary from modifying or injecting
messages between two parties with a symmetric secret key; thus, it makes replay attacks ineffective.
(A) True, (B) False

 message authentication code (MAC) is a short piece of information used to confirm that the message came from the stated sender (its authenticity) and has not been changed. 
 However, to allow the receiver to be able to detect replay attacks, the message itself must contain data that assures that this same message can only be sent once

answer: B


2. True or false: In the Needham-Schroeder protocol, each participating party (e.g., A or B) becomes an
encryption oracle to the other; i.e., provide a ciphertext for a plaintext chosen by another party.
(A) True, (B) False

answer: B




3. True or false: All entity authentication protocols require on-line (i.e., always on, always accessible)
trusted third parties.
(A) True, (B) False

answer: B




4. True or false: The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol needs a trusted third party to determine the
group parameters used for shared-secret generation.
(A) True, (B) False

answer: A




5. True or false: Whenever n = p · q, where p and q are distinct primes, finding Euler’s totient function of
n, denoted by φ(n), allows finding secret key d efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time in the length of n).
(A) True, (B) False

answer: A **




6. True or false: A hash function that is second pre-image resistant is not necessarily pre-image resistant.
(A) True, (B) False

answer: B
